## Authentication

### JWT Implementation

- **Secret Management**: JWT secrets are stored in environment variables and never hardcoded
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
- **Secure Cookies**: Authentication cookies are set with `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `sameSite` flags
- **Purpose Claim**: Tokens include a purpose claim to prevent token misuse

### Password Security

- **Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factor
- **Validation**: Password strength is validated during registration and password changes
- **Storage**: Only password hashes are stored, never plaintext passwords

## API Security

### Route Protection

- **Middleware**: Protected routes are secured using middleware that verifies JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin routes require appropriate role claims in the JWT
- **Error Handling**: Authentication errors return generic messages to prevent information leakage

### Rate Limiting

- **Login Protection**: Authentication endpoints are rate-limited to prevent brute force attacks
- **API Limits**: All API endpoints have rate limits to prevent abuse
- **IP-Based**: Rate limits are applied per IP address

## Data Validation

### Input Sanitization

- **XSS Prevention**: All user input is sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- **Type Checking**: Input is validated for correct types and formats
- **Length Limits**: String inputs have appropriate length limits

### Output Encoding

- **HTML Escaping**: Data displayed in the UI is properly escaped
- **JSON Encoding**: API responses use proper JSON encoding

## CSRF Protection

- **Token Validation**: CSRF tokens are required for all state-changing operations
- **Double Submit Cookie**: Implements the double submit cookie pattern
- **SameSite Cookies**: Cookies are set with SameSite attribute

## Rate Limiting

- **Authentication**: Login attempts are limited to 5 per minute per IP
- **API Endpoints**: General API endpoints are limited to 60 requests per minute
- **Exponential Backoff**: Repeated failures result in increasing wait times

## Security Headers

The application sets the following security headers:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by disallowing framing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser feature usage

## Environment Variables

- **Secrets**: All secrets and credentials are stored in environment variables
- **Validation**: Environment variables are validated at startup
- **Defaults**: Secure defaults are provided for development, but production requires proper configuration

## Database Security

- **Connection Security**: Database connections use TLS/SSL
- **Query Parameterization**: All database queries use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Least Privilege**: Database users have minimal required permissions
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest

## Dependency Management

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: npm audit or similar tools are used to check for known vulnerabilities
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary dependencies are included

## Deployment Security

- **HTTPS**: All production deployments use HTTPS
- **CI/CD Security**: CI/CD pipelines include security scanning
- **Infrastructure Security**: Production infrastructure follows security best practices
- **Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring and auditing
